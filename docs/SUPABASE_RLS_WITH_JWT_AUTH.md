# Integrating Supabase Storage RLS with Your JWT Auth System

## Overview

Your CodebeGen backend uses **custom JWT authentication** (not Supabase Auth). This means:
- ‚úÖ User IDs are in JWT token claims (`sub`)
- ‚úÖ Stored in your PostgreSQL `users` table
- ‚úÖ Needs custom RLS policies for Supabase Storage

## üîë Your Auth System

```python
# From: app/auth/dependencies.py
# JWT Token contains: {"sub": user_id, ...}
# Decoded by: jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
```

## üîí Two Approaches for RLS Policies

### Approach 1: Use Service Role Key (Recommended for Now)

**Simplest approach** - The backend uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` which **bypasses RLS entirely**.

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No RLS policy setup needed
- ‚úÖ Backend manages all authorization
- ‚úÖ Your JWT auth controls access
- ‚úÖ Fastest implementation
- ‚úÖ Easy to debug

**Cons:**
- Direct Supabase Storage API calls need to validate JWT themselves
- Not suitable if frontend calls Supabase Storage directly

**Current Status:** Your implementation already uses this approach!

```python
# From: app/services/supabase_storage_service.py
supabase = create_client(
    settings.SUPABASE_URL, 
    settings.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY  # ‚Üê Bypasses RLS
)
```

### Approach 2: Custom RLS Policies (Advanced)

For maximum security, implement RLS policies that work with your JWT system.

**Setup Steps:**

#### Step 1: Store User IDs in Supabase Auth

You have two options:

**Option A: Sync Your Users to Supabase Auth**
```python
# Create a Supabase auth user for each CodebeGen user
# Store their CodebeGen user_id in custom claims

{
  "sub": "supabase-auth-id",
  "custom_claims": {
    "codebegen_user_id": "your-user-id"
  }
}
```

**Option B: Use Custom JWT with Supabase (Recommended for you)**
```
Use Supabase's "Custom JWT" feature to trust your JWT tokens
```

#### Step 2: Configure Supabase JWT Settings

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API** in Supabase dashboard
2. Find **JWT Settings** section
3. Keep the JWT Secret for now (we'll use Service Role Key instead)

#### Step 3: Create RLS Policies

**For your current system, use this approach:**

Since you control the backend and use Service Role Key, the RLS policies protect against:
- Direct API access without authentication
- Unauthorized access through other means

**Policy 1: Prevent Anonymous Access**
```sql
-- Name: "Prevent anonymous access"
-- Operation: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
-- Target roles: anon

-- Policy definition:
false  -- Always deny anonymous
```

**Policy 2: Allow Service Role (Backend)**
```sql
-- Name: "Backend service role can manage all"
-- Operation: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
-- Target roles: service_role

-- Policy definition:
true  -- Always allow service_role
```

#### Step 4: Apply Policies in Supabase

1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Policies** in Supabase dashboard
2. Select bucket: `codebegen-projects`
3. Add the policies above

## üéØ Best Practice for Your Setup

Your current implementation is **production-ready** because:

‚úÖ **Backend Authorization**
```python
# app/routers/generations.py
async def get_generation(
    generation_id: str,
    current_user: UserResponse = Depends(get_current_user),  # ‚Üê JWT validated
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_async_db)
):
    # Backend validates user owns this generation
    generation = await generation_repo.get_by_id(generation_id)
    if generation.user_id != current_user.id:
        raise HTTPException(403, "Forbidden")
```

‚úÖ **Service Role Used**
```python
# Backend uses service_role key (bypasses RLS)
# Only authenticated requests reach here
```

‚úÖ **Double Authorization**
```
Request ‚Üí JWT Validation (FastAPI) ‚Üí Authorization (Backend Logic) ‚Üí Supabase
```

## üìã Implementation Checklist

### Current Status (Already Done)
- [x] Service Role Key in `.env`
- [x] Cloud storage initialized
- [x] Backend validates user ownership
- [x] No RLS policies needed yet

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add RLS policies for defense-in-depth
- [ ] Frontend secure URLs for direct downloads
- [ ] Implement signed URLs with expiry

## üîê Security Comparison

### Your Current Approach (Service Role Key)
```
User Request
    ‚Üì
FastAPI JWT Validation (app/auth/dependencies.py)
    ‚Üì
Business Logic Authorization (e.g., "user owns project?")
    ‚Üì
Service Role API Call to Supabase
    ‚Üì
Success/Error Response

Security: ‚úÖ Strong (multiple validation layers)
Complexity: ‚úÖ Low
```

### Alternative: RLS Policies Only
```
User Request with JWT
    ‚Üì
Supabase Auth JWT Validation
    ‚Üì
RLS Policy Evaluation
    ‚Üì
Success/Error Response

Security: ‚úÖ Strong (RLS enforces all rules)
Complexity: ‚ö†Ô∏è High (requires JWT format compatibility)
```

## üí° Recommendations

### For Production (Current Approach)
**Keep using Service Role Key** because:
1. Your JWT system is custom and robust
2. Backend controls all authorization
3. Simple to implement and debug
4. No RLS policy maintenance needed
5. Works great for backend-driven applications

### Code Example: Current Flow
```python
# User authenticates with JWT
@router.post("/generate")
async def generate(
    request: GenerationRequest,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),  # JWT validated
):
    # Backend validates ownership
    project = await project_repo.get_by_id(request.project_id)
    if project.user_id != current_user.id:
        raise HTTPException(403)
    
    # Storage helper uses service role (trusted)
    await storage_helper.save_generation_with_cloud(
        project_id=project.id,  # Only accessible user can reach here
        generation_id=generation_id,
        version=version,
        files=files
    )
```

## üöÄ If You Want Frontend Direct Access Later

If frontend needs direct Supabase Storage access (e.g., download files without backend):

### Option 1: Signed URLs (Recommended)
```python
# Backend generates time-limited signed URL
download_url = await storage_manager.get_download_url(
    project_id=project_id,
    generation_id=generation_id,
    version=version
)
# Returns: https://...supabase.co/...?token=xyz (1 hour expiry)
# Frontend can download with this URL
```

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ Already implemented!

```python
# From: app/services/storage_integration_helper.py
async def get_download_url_for_generation(
    self,
    project_id: str,
    generation_id: str,
    version: int
) -> Optional[str]:
    """Returns signed cloud URL with local fallback"""
```

### Option 2: Row-Level Security (Advanced)
Would require converting your JWT to Supabase Auth format.
