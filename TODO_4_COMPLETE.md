# Todo #4 Complete: FileManager Enhanced with Hierarchical Storage

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**File:** `app/services/file_manager.py`

---

## 📝 What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Added Hierarchical Storage Methods

**New Methods Added:**

#### `save_generation_files_hierarchical()`
- **Purpose:** Save files with new hierarchical structure
- **Path Format:** `{project_id}/generations/v{version}__{generation_id}/`
- **Features:**
  - Creates `source/` directory for generated code
  - Creates `artifacts/` directory for build outputs (ZIPs, etc.)
  - Generates `manifest.json` with metadata
  - Calculates file count and total size
  - Returns storage path, file count, and size

**Manifest Structure:**
```json
{
  "generation_id": "uuid",
  "project_id": "uuid",
  "version": 1,
  "created_at": "2025-10-14T...",
  "file_count": 24,
  "total_size_bytes": 45678,
  "files": ["app/__init__.py", "main.py", ...],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

#### `create_generation_diff()`
- **Purpose:** Create diff between two generation versions
- **Features:**
  - Uses system `diff` command if available (Unix/Linux/Git Bash)
  - Falls back to simple comparison if `diff` not available
  - Saves diff as `.patch` file: `diff_from_v{previous_version}.patch`
  - Shows added, removed, and modified files

**Fallback Diff Format:**
```
=== Diff from v1__abc123 to v2__def456 ===

📄 Added files (3):
  + app/new_feature.py
  + tests/test_new_feature.py
  + docs/feature.md

📝 Modified files (5):
  ~ main.py
  ~ requirements.txt
  ~ README.md
```

#### `set_active_generation_symlink()`
- **Purpose:** Create symlink/junction to active generation
- **Features:**
  - Creates `{project_id}/generations/active` pointing to current version
  - Windows: Uses junction (`mklink /J`) - no admin required
  - Unix/Linux: Uses symbolic link
  - Removes old symlink before creating new one
  - Gracefully handles symlink failures (optional feature)

#### `cleanup_old_generations()`
- **Purpose:** Archive old generations to save space
- **Parameters:**
  - `keep_latest=5` - Keep N most recent versions
  - `archive_age_days=30` - Archive generations older than N days
- **Features:**
  - Moves old generations to `{project_id}/archive/`
  - Preserves recent generations
  - Returns count of archived items
  - Logs each archival operation

#### `_get_generation_dir()` (Helper)
- **Purpose:** Get generation directory path (supports both structures)
- **Features:**
  - Tries new hierarchical structure first
  - Falls back to old flat structure
  - Searches by version number or generation_id
  - Ensures backward compatibility

#### `_create_simple_diff()` (Helper)
- **Purpose:** Create diff when system `diff` command unavailable
- **Features:**
  - Compares file lists
  - Identifies added, removed, modified files
  - Generates human-readable report

---

### 2. ✅ Updated Existing Methods for Backward Compatibility

#### `save_generation_files()` - Enhanced
**Before:**
```python
async def save_generation_files(self, generation_id: str, files: Dict[str, str]) -> bool:
    await self.create_project_structure(generation_id, files)
```

**After:**
```python
async def save_generation_files(
    self, 
    generation_id: str, 
    files: Dict[str, str],
    project_id: Optional[str] = None,
    version: Optional[int] = None
) -> bool:
    # If project_id and version provided: use new hierarchical
    if project_id and version is not None:
        await self.save_generation_files_hierarchical(...)
    else:
        # Fall back to old flat structure
        await self.create_project_structure(generation_id, files)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Backward compatible with old code
- ✅ Automatically uses new structure when possible
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing calls

#### `get_generation_directory()` - Enhanced
**Before:**
```python
async def get_generation_directory(self, generation_id: str) -> Optional[Path]:
    project_dir = self.storage_path / generation_id
    return project_dir if project_dir.exists() else None
```

**After:**
```python
async def get_generation_directory(
    self, 
    generation_id: str,
    project_id: Optional[str] = None,
    version: Optional[int] = None
) -> Optional[Path]:
    gen_dir = self._get_generation_dir(project_id, version, generation_id)
    # Returns source/ directory for new structure, root for old
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Supports both old and new paths
- ✅ Returns appropriate directory based on structure
- ✅ Graceful degradation

## 📂 New Directory Structure

### Before (Old Flat Structure):
```
./storage/projects/
├── {generation_id_1}/
│   ├── app/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── {generation_id_2}/
│   ├── app/
│   └── main.py
└── {generation_id_3}/
```

### After (New Hierarchical Structure):
```
./storage/projects/
├── {project_id}/
│   ├── generations/
│   │   ├── v1__{generation_id}/
│   │   │   ├── manifest.json          ← Metadata
│   │   │   ├── source/                ← Generated code
│   │   │   │   ├── app/
│   │   │   │   ├── main.py
│   │   │   │   └── requirements.txt
│   │   │   └── artifacts/             ← Build outputs
│   │   ├── v2__{generation_id}/
│   │   │   ├── manifest.json
│   │   │   ├── source/
│   │   │   ├── artifacts/
│   │   │   └── diff_from_v1.patch     ← Diff from previous
│   │   └── active -> v2__{id}         ← Symlink (optional)
│   └── archive/                       ← Old generations
│       └── v0__{old_generation_id}/
```
