## Testing Verification

### Test 1: Classic Generation
```bash
POST /generate
{
  "prompt": "Create a user management system with posts",
  "tech_stack": "fastapi_postgres",
  "generation_mode": "classic"
}

# Expected: 15+ SSE events
# Verify: Browser DevTools → Network → EventSource shows events
```

### Test 2: Enhanced Generation
```bash
POST /generate
{
  "prompt": "Create a user management system with posts",
  "tech_stack": "fastapi_postgres",
  "generation_mode": "enhanced"
}

# Expected: 18+ SSE events (includes context_analysis)
# Verify: Additional "Analyzing project context" event at 5%
```

### Test 3: Iteration
```bash
POST /iterate
{
  "parent_generation_id": "xxx",
  "prompt": "Add missing schema files"
}

# Expected: 10 SSE events
# Verify: "Detected intent: add" event appears
```
